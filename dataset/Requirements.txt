Create a dashboard for the Call Centre Manager to understand the trends.

KPIs to include (to get started, but not limited to):
• Overall customer satisfaction
• Overall calls answered/abandoned
• Calls by time
• Average speed of answer
• Agent's performance quadrant -> average handle time (talk duration) vs calls answered

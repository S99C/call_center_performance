Create a dashboard for the Call Centre Manager to
understand todays trends


For example:
total number Of calls answered and abandoned,
speed of answer,
length of calls,
overall customer satisfaction, etc.

What I'm after is an accurate overview of long-term
trends in customer and agent behaviour.

..........................................................................

Possible KPIs include (to get you started, but not limited to):
• Overall customer satisfaction
• Overall calls answered/abandoned
• Calls by time
• Average speed of answer
• Agent's performance quadrant -> average handle time (talk duration) vs calls answered
